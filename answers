1.Create a query that calculates the average number of goals per game between 1900 and 2000.

Select avg(home_score+away_score)as avg_goals_per_game from results where date between "1900-01-01" and "2000-12-31"

2.Create a query that counts the number of shootouts wins by country and arrange in alphabetical order
 Select winner, count(*)as wins from shootouts 
Group by winner
Order by winner

3.Create a reliable key that allows the joining together of goal scorers, results, and shootouts
  Creating a new column called Match_id for every table
  Alter Table Goalscorers Add Match_id varchar(255);
  Update Goalscorers 
  Set match_id = concat(date,'.',home_team,'.',away_team);

  Alter Table Results Add Match_id varchar(255);
  Update Results
  Set match_id = concat(date,'.',home_team,'.',away_team);

  Alter Table Shootout Add Match_id varchar(255);
  Update Shootout
  Set match_id = concat(date,'.',home_team,'.',away_team);

4.Create a query that identifies which teams have won a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw.
  Select s.winner from results r join shootout s on r.match_id = s.match_id
  Where r.home_score = 1 AND r.away_score = 1

5.Create a query that identifies the top goal scorer by tournament, and what percentage that equates to for all goals scored in the tournament.
  To identify the top goal scorer by tournament, we need to join the goalscorer and results table using the newly created match_id and then group it by scorer and tournament.

With scorer AS (select g.scorer, r.tournament, count(*)as goals_by_scorer from goalscorer g join results r on r.match_id = g.match_id group by r.tournament, g.scorer),TournamentGoals AS (Select tournament, sum(home_score + away_score) As Total_goals from results group by tournament )

Select S.tournament, S.scorer, S.goals_by_scorer, T.tournament, T.Total_gaols (S.goals_by_scorer*100/T.Total_goals) as Goal_percentage from scorer S join Tournament T on S.Tournament = T.Tournament 
Where S.goals_by_scorer = (select max(goals_by_scorer) from scorer S1 where s1.tournament = s.tournament);
